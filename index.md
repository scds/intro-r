# Introduction to R Programming

R has a powerful suite of high-level statistical functions, but sometimes you need lower-level control over the functionality of your script. No prior knowledge of R is required. In this workshop, you will learn how to write programs in R using functions and control flow. We will cover variables, data types, functions, conditional blocks, loops, and debugging. 

This workshop is offered by the Data Analysis Support Hub (DASH). [Get in touch with DASH.](https://library.mcmaster.ca/services/dash)

## Prerequisites

- A local installation of R and RStudio (this will be covered in the Preparation page)

<!-- What will the student learn to do, learn to use, etc. -->
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Understand what R is and what it can be used for
- Work with R's atomic data structures
- Use collections to store data
- Control the flow of a program using conditional statements and loops
- Create and use functions
